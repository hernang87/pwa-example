# PWA Example
This is a small example of a PWA using offline caching.
The example was built using **PWA Universal Builder** (https://pwa.cafe/)

Clone and run `npm install`or `yarn`.

Then use the following commands (from the PWA Cli).

```sh
# Run development/live-reload server
$ pwa watch
# Build production bundle(s)
$ pwa build
# Generate static HTML exports
$ pwa export
```
